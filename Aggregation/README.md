# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline
- aggregation is a relationship between two classes that represent a whole part or a "has a" association
    - form of association where one class is composed of one or more instance of another class, but the relationship is not strictly exclusive and the child objects can exist without the parent object
    - one class(the aggregate) has a reference to another class(the component)
    - the reference implies a connection or dependency between two classes
- allows one class to contain objects of another class, but the objects can exist independently
- you can create a pipeline in which all the documnets in a collection will go through and be processed step by step in order to transform them into a aggregated result
