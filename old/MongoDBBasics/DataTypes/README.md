# Basic Data Types
- strings: "hello"
- boolean: true/false

## Numbers
- MongoDB Shell is based on JS and JS does not diffrentiate between numbers and floating Point values
	- every number will be stored as a 64 bit floating point number in the mongodb shell
	- `{age:22}`, 22 will be stored as a floating point number not as integer
	- `typeof db.collectionName.findOne().age`data type will be returned as a number
- NumberInt(Int32): integer value up to 32 bits long  
- NumberLong(Int64): integer value up to 64 bits long
- NumberDecimal: decimals
- ObjectID: special object automatically generated by MongoDB to give you a unique ID
	- this unique ID contains a random string and a temporal componenet
	- there is a sorting built on to this ID because of the timestamp it was created on
## Date
- ISODate: date
	- `new Date()`: current date and time
- Timestamp: used mostly internally, but you can use it
	- `new Timestamp()`: current time

- `db.stats()`: utility operator that give us the stats of a db
	- gives info such as number of collections, total size, average object size etc.....
