# Collections
- a collection is a collection of one or more documents
    - you can think of a collection as a table and documents as table rows

# Documents
- a document is a json file with one or more objects
- each object is a document/row of data
- each document has one or more key value pairs/fields
- documents are created using BSON(Binary JSON)
    - so documents are BSON documents
    - we dont need to learn BSON because as developers we still use JSON format and MongoDB takes care of converting it to BSON and saving it to the disk
