# MongoDB Shell
To work with MongoDB Server we need a Client called MongoDB Shell
 interactive JS interface for querying and modifying database data
        - can also be used to perform administrator operations such as creating databases, collections etc...
        - issues the same commands to the database server as MongoDB Compass
        - [Click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jH__3ieGS0) to be taken to a video that will show you how to do this. Start at the 4:30 mark

        - from the start menu type `Service` and click on it and it will show you a lit of services running in the background, you can start and stop the services
